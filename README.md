# AI_Drone_Project_Ideas
This repository contains AI project ideas that can be implemented in drone R&amp;D environments. These were prepared with a focus on practical applications such as surveillance, security, and autonomous flight. Korean version is available in `README_ko.md`.

# AI Technologies for UAVs (R&D Team)

## üß† AI Feature 1: Auto Parameter Setting

Automatically configure UAV parameters based on sensor selection, GPS, shape, and parts.

- Automatically suggest parameters when selecting sensors, GPS, frame, or components
- AutoML-based parameter recommendation system
- Technologies: `Isolation Forest`, `Autoencoder`, `Reinforcement Learning`, `Python automation scripts`

---

## üö® AI Feature 2: Anomaly Detection & Error Monitoring

Detect anomalies before UAV crashes using flight logs and sensor data.

- Predictive detection of abnormal signs using flight logs and sensor data
- Technologies: `Isolation Forest`, `Autoencoder`, `LSTM-based sequence modeling`
- Goal: Early warning system to detect issues before UAV damage or failure

## üéØ AI Feature 3: Real-Time Face Detection & Tracking

Use UAV camera feeds to recognize and follow human faces in real time.

- Real-time face detection and drone tracking using vision models
- Applications: Surveillance, security, personal drones, and search/rescue
- Technologies: `YOLOv8`, `MediaPipe`, `OpenCV`, `DeepSort`, `MobileNet`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AI Feature 4: Auto Fault Classification

Diagnose which part of the UAV is failing based on sensor data.

- Instead of just detecting "something is wrong," determine *what* is wrong
- Example: Classify issues like motor failure, battery drain, GPS error, etc.
- Technologies: `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`, `Explainable AI (XAI)`

---

## üîä AI Feature 5: Voice Command Control System

Control UAV behavior via simple voice commands.

- Voice input to control takeoff, landing, photography, etc.
- Languages: Korean, English, Uzbek, etc.
- Technologies: `Speech Recognition`, `Natural Language Processing`, `TTS`, `Whisper`, `Vosk`, `Edge AI deployment`
